* Ammonite.el

This is a simple extension of ~ansi-term~ for ~ammonite~. It's developed as a back-end for ~ob-scala.el~

** ob-scala.el

Please make sure this mod place in ~load-path~ first to use ~ammonite~ as ob-scala's backend. [[[[https://github.com/ensime/emacs-scala-mode]]][scala-mode]] has own ~ob-scala.el~ which is backed by ~ensime~.

Have fun!:

** Conventional predef.sc

It looks for ~predef.sc~ location conventionally. If the file path of current buffer is ~$HOME/my/node/scala.org~, it will search the file in following order:

1. ~$HOME/my/node/predef.sc~
2. ~$HOME/my/predef.sc~
3. ~$HOME/predef.sc~

For example If the path is ~$HOME/my/node/predef.sc~, ammonite command will be ~amm --predef $HOME/my/node/predef.sc~. If current buffer has no path or ~predef.sc~ is not found, it will be ~amm~ as default.

** Examples

#+INCLUDE: "predef.sc" src scala

The codes can be evaluated without ~imports~, because ~import java.time._~ is defined in ~predef.sc~:

LocalDateTime.now()
